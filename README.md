# AoC Challenge: 2015

### Approach

My first idea was to use a Rails/React/Postgres-stack to systematically solve each problem to  showcase my familiarity with the tech in the job description. However, considering two dev mantras I use as guidelines, YAGNI and DTSTTCPW, I decided a more minimal approach was appropriate.

I need a conventional approach challenge, so I went with my second idea: using ruby hoe gem which creates a great starting point with a module and tests, even if not ultimately used as a gem.
