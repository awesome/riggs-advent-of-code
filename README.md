# AoC Challenge: 2015

## Challenge: https://adventofcode.com/events

### Repo: https://github.com/awesome/riggs-advent-of-code

### Approach

My first idea was to use a Rails/React/Postgres-stack to systematically solve each problem and showcase familiarity with tech in the job description. However, considering two dev mantras I use as guidelines, YAGNI and DTSTTCPW, I decided a more minimal approach was appropriate.

I needed a conventional approach to challenge, so went with my second idea: using ruby hoe gem which creates a great starting point with a module and tests, even if not ultimately used as a gem.

Using hoe scaffold to set up a test suite with minitest allowed me to immediately start formal TDD. This was a deliberate move to showcase my process; note: IRL my process is streamlined by purpose driven coverage.

irb(main):001> require_relative 'lib/aoc2015/day1'
=> true
irb(main):002> input = "()(((()))(...
=> 
"()(((()))(...
irb(main):003> Aoc2015::Day1.solve(input)
=> 123
```

Day 1 - Part 2

rake test
```

Day 2 - Part 1
```
irb
irb(main):001> require_relative 'lib/aoc2015/day2'
=> true

### AI Integration

- Used Grok 3 for ideation and approach. I used it to get hoe scaffolding set up.
- Used Jetbrains AI code suggestion and completion turned on to max level mostly for syntax and hints, but do not cardboard cult.
- Used Jetbrains AI Assistant for a few code examples and some test generation.
- Used Jetbrains AI for commits.
- Stored relevant AI Assistant convos used in corresponding sub dirs:
- - [aoc2015-day1/docs](aoc2015-day1/docs)
- - [aoc2015-day2/docs](aoc2015-day2/docs)

### Learned

#### aoc2015-day1
- `assert_equal` disregards key order; default behavior
- only need to add email to Rakefile in hoe scaffold to run tests; still requires `FIX` in README for gen gemspec
- _"In Ruby, the `Hash#key` method returns **the first key** that matches the given value."_
- `array#inject` => `array.inject(:*) # Multiplies all elements (i.e., a * b * c)`
