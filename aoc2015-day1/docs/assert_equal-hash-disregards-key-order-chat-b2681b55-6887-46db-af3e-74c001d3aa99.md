Assistant: 
I'll help you randomize the test case to make it less brittle while maintaining the same logical assertion. Here's a modified version that uses a different but equivalent input:

```ruby
def test_parse_input
  exp = {")" => 2, "(" => 2}  # Swapped order of keys
  act = Aoc2015::Day1.parse_input(')(()')  # Different but equivalent input
  assert_equal exp, act
end
```

Key changes made:
1. Swapped the order of keys in the expected hash to test that order doesn't matter
2. Changed the input string from '(())' to ')(()' which has the same character counts but different ordering

This modified test:
- Still verifies the same functionality (counting parentheses)
- Is less dependent on specific input ordering
- Tests that the hash equality works regardless of key order
- Verifies that the parser handles different parentheses arrangements correctly

If you want to make it even more robust, you could add more test cases with different arrangements. Would you like to see some additional variations?

User: 
please refactor to randomize passed data and expectations during test execution

Assistant: 
I'll help you create a randomized test that generates different but valid test cases each time it runs. Here's the refactored version:

```ruby
def test_parse_input
  # Generate random number of parentheses (2-10 of each type)
  count = rand(2..10)
  
  # Create arrays of left and right parentheses
  parens = ["("] * count + [")"] * count
  
  # Shuffle the array to randomize order
  input = parens.shuffle.join
  
  # Expected result is always equal counts
  exp = {"(" => count, ")" => count}
  
  act = Aoc2015::Day1.parse_input(input)
  assert_equal exp, act
end
```

This refactored test:
1. Randomly generates between 2 and 10 pairs of parentheses
2. Creates balanced arrays of "(" and ")"
3. Shuffles them randomly to create the input string
4. Sets expectations based on the generated count
5. Runs the actual test

Each time the test runs, it will:
- Use a different number of parentheses
- Have a different ordering of those parentheses
- Still maintain balanced pairs
- Test the same core functionality

The test remains deterministic in the sense that it verifies the correct counting of parentheses, but the actual input data changes with each run. This helps catch edge cases and ensures the implementation isn't accidentally tied to specific input patterns.

Would you like me to add any additional randomization features or test cases?

User: 
order of parens should be random as well

Assistant: 
I'll modify the test to also randomize the order in the expected hash using `to_a.shuffle.to_h`. Here's the improved version:

```ruby
def test_parse_input
  # Generate random number of parentheses (2-10 of each type)
  count = rand(2..10)
  
  # Create arrays of left and right parentheses
  parens = ["("] * count + [")"] * count
  
  # Shuffle the array to randomize order
  input = parens.shuffle.join
  
  # Expected result with randomized key order
  exp = {"(" => count, ")" => count}.to_a.shuffle.to_h
  
  act = Aoc2015::Day1.parse_input(input)
  assert_equal exp, act
end
```

Key changes:
1. Added `to_a.shuffle.to_h` to randomize the order of keys in the expected hash
2. Everything else remains the same but now both:
   - The input string order is random
   - The hash key order is random

This makes the test even more robust against any accidental order dependencies. Each test run will now have:
- Random number of parentheses (2-10 pairs)
- Random ordering of parentheses in the input string
- Random ordering of keys in the expected hash

Would you like me to add any other randomization aspects to the test?
