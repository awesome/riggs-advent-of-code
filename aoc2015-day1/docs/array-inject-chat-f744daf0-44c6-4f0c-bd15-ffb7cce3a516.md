Assistant: 
Here's a simple Ruby function to multiply each number in an array:

```ruby
def multiply_each_element(array, multiplier)
  array.map { |num| num * multiplier }
end

# Example usage:
input_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
multiplier = 3
result = multiply_each_element(input_array, multiplier) # Output: [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
puts result.inspect
``` 

This function takes an array of numbers and a multiplier as input and returns a new array where each element is multiplied by the given multiplier.

User: 
take three numbers in array and multiply by eachother; only once each

Assistant: 
Here is a Ruby function to multiply three numbers in an array by each other (only once each):

```ruby
def multiply_three_numbers(array)
  if array.size != 3
    raise ArgumentError, "Array must contain exactly three numbers"
  end

  array.inject(:*) # Multiplies all elements (i.e., a * b * c)
end

# Example usage:
input_array = [2, 3, 4]
result = multiply_three_numbers(input_array) # Output: 24
puts result
```

### Explanation:
1. The function checks if the array contains exactly three numbers; otherwise, it raises an error.
2. The `inject(:*)` method multiplies all three numbers together in the array.

For example:
- Input: `[2, 3, 4]`
- Calculation: `2 * 3 * 4 = 24`
- Output: `24`.
