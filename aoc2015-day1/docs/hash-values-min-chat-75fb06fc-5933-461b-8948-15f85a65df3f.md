- because the job title has rails, postgres and react in the name,
my gut was to use that stack to address the code problem.
-- that stack gave me more than enough options to solve the AoC problems while having fun
- having fun to me is being creative with solutions, while constrained by time, budget,
the YAGNI mantra, and the DTSTTCPW mantra
- once I've established my guidelines I'll proceed to create a rails app with postgres and react
- then I'll create some

first i need a convention to approach challenge; using ruby hoe gem creates a great starting point


https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1

- since order of characters is idempotent for results, 

- created the remote repo; will push shortly
- ran into an issue with hoe scaffold: dash number will like foo-2015 will create a module Foo::-2015 which will error
- fixed the issue by scaffold with `aoc2015-day1`
- got the repo to where i wanted; taking a break--will push when i get back (config creds local to github)
- pushed to repo https://github.com/awesome/riggs-advent-of-code/commits/master/
- begin code challenge
- checked in failing test for stubbed parse method
- wrote code to make test pass
- used ai to make test less brittle 
- ai's updated test method didn't fail as expected--minitest `assert_equal` disregards key order in hash
- added more tests to lock in behavior
- stubbed a new method and wrote test for calculation of level; test fails
- made test pass; checked in
- stubbed new method and wrote test for runner (solve)
- made test pass; pushed to remote; break time
- added usage instructions to README
- submitted answer; correct: got one gold star
- - > That's the right answer! You are one gold star closer to powering the weather machine. [Continue to Part Two]

- started on day1 part two
- wrote stub method and one ai gen test with new conditions
- committed failing test
- fixed code and commit/pushed

- started on day2 part one
- created gem scaffold with hoe
- wrote stubs and failing tests using provided data: https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2
- jumped into irb to play around with formula 
- usually I'd add code comments alongside or circle back, but instructions said not to use text from problems

Assistant: 
In Ruby, you can find the lowest value from a hash where the keys represent dimensions, and each value is an integer, using the following approach:

```ruby
# Initialize the hash
hash = { l: l, w: w, h: h }

# Find the lowest value
lowest_value = hash.values.min

puts lowest_value
```

### Explanation:
1. **`hash.values`**: Retrieves all the values from the hash as an array.
2. **`.min`**: Finds the smallest value in the array.

This will give you the lowest integer value among `l`, `w`, and `h`.

User: 
thanks, now refactor to find key with lowest value

Assistant: 
To find the key with the lowest value in the hash instead of the actual lowest value, you can use the `key` method with the result of `.min`. Hereâ€™s the refactored solution:

```ruby
# Initialize the hash
hash = { l: l, w: w, h: h }

# Find the key with the lowest value
key_with_lowest_value = hash.key(hash.values.min)

puts key_with_lowest_value
```

### Explanation:
1. **`hash.values.min`**: Finds the lowest value among all the hash values.
2. **`hash.key(value)`**: Returns the key corresponding to the provided value.

This way, you will get the key (`:l`, `:w`, or `:h`) that has the lowest associated value.

User: 
if two values match, will the lowest value key be first occurrence or alphanumeric precedence?

Assistant: 
In Ruby, the `Hash#key` method returns **the first key** that matches the given value. This is because Ruby hashes maintain **insertion order** as of Ruby 1.9 and later. It does not evaluate based on alphanumeric precedence in this case.

### Example to Demonstrate:
```ruby
hash = { w: 5, h: 3, l: 3 } 

key_with_lowest_value = hash.key(hash.values.min)

puts key_with_lowest_value
```

### Breakdown:
- `hash.values.min`: The minimum value is `3`.
- `hash.key(3)`: Ruby will find the **first key** associated with the value `3`. In this case, the key `:h` appears first in insertion order, so it will return `:h`.

### Output:
```
h
```

So the result is **based on the first occurrence of the value**, not alphanumeric order.
