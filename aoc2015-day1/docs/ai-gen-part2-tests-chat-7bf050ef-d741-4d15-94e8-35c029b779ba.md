write two tests one for each of the scenarios using the established test conventions in file:

```
) causes him to enter the basement at character position 1.

- because the job title has rails, postgres and react in the name,
my gut was to use that stack to address the code problem.
-- that stack gave me more than enough options to solve the AoC problems while having fun
- having fun to me is being creative with solutions, while constrained by time, budget,
the YAGNI mantra, and the DTSTTCPW mantra
- once I've established my guidelines I'll proceed to create a rails app with postgres and react
- then I'll create some

first i need a convention to approach challenge; using ruby hoe gem creates a great starting point


https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1

- since order of characters is idempotent for results, 

- created the remote repo; will push shortly
- ran into an issue with hoe scaffold: dash number will like foo-2015 will create a module Foo::-2015 which will error
- fixed the issue by scaffold with `aoc2015-day1`
- got the repo to where i wanted; taking a break--will push when i get back (config creds local to github)
- pushed to repo https://github.com/awesome/riggs-advent-of-code/commits/master/
- begin code challenge
- checked in failing test for stubbed parse method
- wrote code to make test pass
- used ai to make test less brittle 
- ai's updated test method didn't fail as expected--minitest `assert_equal` disregards key order in hash
- added more tests to lock in behavior
- stubbed a new method and wrote test for calculation of level; test fails
- made test pass; checked in
- stubbed new method and wrote test for runner (solve)
- made test pass; pushed to remote; break time
- added usage instructions to README
- submitted answer; correct: got one gold star
- - > That's the right answer! You are one gold star closer to powering the weather machine. [Continue to Part Two]

# AoC Challenge: 2015

## https://adventofcode.com/events

### Approach

My first idea was to use a Rails/React/Postgres-stack to systematically solve each problem to  showcase my familiarity with the tech in the job description. However, considering two dev mantras I use as guidelines, YAGNI and DTSTTCPW, I decided a more minimal approach was appropriate.

I need a conventional approach challenge, so I went with my second idea: using ruby hoe gem which creates a great starting point with a module and tests, even if not ultimately used as a gem.

Assistant: 
Based on the test file and problem description, I'll help you write two tests for the enter_basement scenarios. The tests should follow the existing convention in the test file which uses Minitest.

Let's add these test cases to the empty `test_enter_basement` method:

```ruby
def test_enter_basement
  # Test case 1: ) causes basement entry at position 1
  input = ")"
  exp = 1
  act = Aoc2015::Day1.enter_basement(input)
  assert_equal exp, act

  # Test case 2: ()()) causes basement entry at position 5
  input = "()())"
  exp = 5
  act = Aoc2015::Day1.enter_basement(input)
  assert_equal exp, act
end
```

The tests follow the established pattern in the file:
1. They use descriptive comments for each test case
2. Follow the input/exp/act/assert pattern seen in other tests
3. Use `assert_equal` for assertions
4. Each test case verifies a specific scenario from the problem description

Note that you'll need to implement the `enter_basement` method in the `Aoc2015::Day1` module to make these tests pass. The method should track the floor level as it processes each character and return the position (1-based index) where the character causes Santa to first enter the basement (when level becomes -1).
